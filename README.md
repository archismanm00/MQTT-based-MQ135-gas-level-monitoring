# MQTT-based-MQ135-gas-level-monitoring
Measuring gas levels using MQ135 sensor and live monitoring them over the internet using MQTT and React


Gas levels were measured using an Arduino and Mq135 sensor and were sent over MQTT protocol(for bandwidth limited use cases like industrial environments) using an esp8266 module. The final data was displayed on a react based live dashboard.
